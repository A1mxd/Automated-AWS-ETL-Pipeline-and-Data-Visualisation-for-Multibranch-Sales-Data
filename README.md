# COOL BEANS FINAL PROJECT

### We are building a system to create statistics and analysis of data of what client is selling and how to grow customers by keeping existing ones and reaching new customers.

## Description

The café has seen unprecedented growth and has expanded to hundreds of outlets across the country. Due to the demand the company is receiving, they need to figure out how they can best target new and returning customers, and also understand which products are selling well. Our client are experiencing issues with collating and analysing the data they are producing at each branch, as their technical setup is limited.

This pipeline will collect all the transaction data generated by each individual café and place it in a single location. By being able to easily query the company's data as a whole, the client will drastically increase their ability to identify company-wide trends and insights.

## Elevator Pitch

**For** the existing client 
**who** needs an updated system to figure out how they can best target new and returning customers, and also understand which products are selling well, 
**The Cool Beans System** is an identifying, tracking and analysing system of trends of the performance of their business. 
**Unlike** their previous system, 
**our product** will obtain, process, store, collate and analyse the data they are producing at each branch and increase their ability to identify company-wide trends and insights.

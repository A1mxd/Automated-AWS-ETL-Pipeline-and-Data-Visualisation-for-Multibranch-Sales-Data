# WAYS OF WORKING

### This document details the ways of working for Cool Beans Final Project. This document is ever evolving, please feel empowered to make changes where appropriate.

----
## Technology Stack
* The project consists of AWS.
* Python 3.
* Data is stored in PostgreSQL for it's ease of access (will be integrated with AWS Cloud).

----

## Agile Principles
* The team works in a Kanban working style, using Trello tickets.
* We keep our MoSCoW in our Trello board to be able to keep ourselves on track, and not losing the orientation.
* We are using sprint method to meet the weekly goals. 
* We number our weekly sprint goals with a whole number, then we number smaller tasks with decimals starting related week's whole number. (ex. 1 and 1.2)
* We assign the team member to the tasks by labeling their names to the related tickets.
* We use color coding to distinguishing the MoSCoW goals. 
* Everyday, we organise 15 min Stand-up, and every week we organise 15 min Retro, to be able to see where we are and what we are doing. 
* We don't expect our members to work out-of-working-hours. 
* We communicate on Slack channel "delon9-cool-beans" and our Zoom breakout room chat. 
* We communicate when we are absent or late through these channels. 
* We ask each other and instructors when we are stuck. We don't wait too long in ambiguity / uncertainty / unknown. We don't stay in the dark. 
* We share information and joy of working as team.

## Issues

To-be-decided

## Epics
 ```OUR SMART GOAL: In a week's time, have a concrete weekly plan. Assign roles and tasks effectively for each cool bean to be able to work as a team efficiently.```

We are spliting the epic goals into smaller chunks using 'to-do weekly breakdown' tickets.

----

## Definition of Done
* Making sure we have completed a unit test for the function and handle any errors that can occur 
* Readability of the code should be easy to understand by commenting/doc strings and having good format(variables and function names should be self explanatory)
* Code carries out all intended functionality
* Agree as a team that the task is done

## Coding Standards
TBD

----

## Version Control Strategy
### Branch naming convention
```
<SPRINT NUMBER>/<TASK NUMBER>.<WEEKLY TO DO LIST TICKET NUMBER>
 e.g. '1/1.2' as 'sprint1/load.insert_into_table'
 e.g. '1/0' as 0 labels bug fixing
```
